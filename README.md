- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Michael.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in guitars. Oh, I mean coding things.

Just kidding. I make simple websites and web-based assets for live video production. That's a fancy way of saying I make graphics for Twitch streamers. If you like something on my page, feel free to fork it ~~or steal it I don't care.~~ I'm active on Twitter if you wanna get in touch.
