- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Michael.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in guitars. Oh, I mean coding things.

Just kidding. I make music and stream video games sometimes. I accidentally do software development (basic front-end design and sometimes gamedev). This is my collection of stuff. I'm gonna find a way to turn this page into a music player, probably.
